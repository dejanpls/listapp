# The List App

## A personal project made after completion of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">TOP Foundations Course</a>

View <a href="https://dejanpls.github.io/listapp/">live version of the app</a> if you need more info on what it does and how it looks like.

### How it works

* Bring focus to ```add new items``` and start typing the item name
* Add item to the list by pressing ```enter``` of by clicking on ```Add Item``` button
* User can ```filter``` through items by pressing the loop icon
* Then, new input section will replace ```Add new items``` section
* Start typing to filter the existing items in the list

Hope you enjoy creating your shopping lists :+1:
