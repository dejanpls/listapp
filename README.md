# The List App

## A personal project of mine, made made after the completion of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations">TOP Foundations Course</a>

View live version of the app <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch">here</a> if you need more info on what it does and how it looks like.

### How it works

* On load, a ```16x16``` grid of square ```div```s is created
* On right-side panel, you can choose between several options
* User can choose between several color buttons
* If clicked ```Select Color```, a popup color palette will display
* If clicked on ```Generate Grid```, you will be prompted to enter a value between ```1-100```
* Using a value entered in ```input``` prompt, a new grid with that value is created (e.g. ```100``` creates a ```100x100``` grid)
* When pressed ```Reset Grid```, it prompts the user to ```confirm``` the action
* If clicked on ```Clear Surface```, ```Confirm``` prompt will appear
* Additionally, an interaction (mouse click inside of a ```grid-box```) adds 10% more black or color to the square.
* The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions (clicks)

Hope you enjoy drawing colors :+1:
